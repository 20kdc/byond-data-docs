This is incomplete documentation regarding BYOND data.

There's a document which is supposed to contain protocol information but research hasn't gone far enough for it to be really worth anything.

extools (SpaceManiac, MCHSL, 1fbff5f83b23d39d38b1dfcb4cac8d9b et al.): DM bytecode information

Notes on this regard: This doesn't contain extools code.
That said, if extools wants me to add their license here, ask via an issue or something.

Tomeno: important parts of string decryption and protocol decryption

BobOfDoom, NGGJamie, Crispy: Documented the BYOND Topic protocol at https://github.com/NGGJamie/byond-topics
This was useful to understand BYOND packet framing, not covering encryption

Stephen001: Partial documentation of some format version (right now unknown but >= 307 < 494) at https://github.com/Stephen001/Lego

The Red Book (Super Saiyan X, LordAndrew, Kaiochao, DarkCampainger et al.): Informed me of the existence of modified types.

ZeWaka: Informed me of the existence of Lummox JR's information on the DMI format (at http://www.byond.com/forum/post/189170#comment1077677 )
